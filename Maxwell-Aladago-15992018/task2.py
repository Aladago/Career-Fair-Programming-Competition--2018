"""
The class employs two of the most popular pattern searching algorithms - 
The Knutt-Morris-Pratt algorithm and the Boyer-Moore algorithm, both published in 
1977. The KMP algorithm is used when the length of the pattern is below a certain arbitrary threshold.
The full version of Boyer-Moore algorithms is used. I.E, pattern re-alignments uses the two techniques:
The bad item rule and the good suffix rule. Any of the method works independently but the two methods wok
well together.
