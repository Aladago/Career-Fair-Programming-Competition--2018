"""
The class employs two of the most popular pattern searching algorithms - 
The Knutt-Morris-Pratt algorithm and the Boyer-Moore algorithm, both published in 
1977. The KMP algorithm is used when the length of the pattern is below a certain 
arbitrary threshold. I used 10 here. This implementation of Boyer-Moore algorithms uses,
both bad item skip rule and good suffix rules for pattern re-alignments:
Any of the method works independently through
