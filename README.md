## Repository Details
This repository contains the instructions, data and code which won the 2018 Ashesi career Fair Programming competition. The competition is a university wide annual programming competition organized by the computer science department. The 2018 competition challenged students to analyze real data gathered from the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and answer some questions. The questions, instructions and specifications of the competition are contained in the file _2018 Ashesi Career Fair Programming Challenge.pdf_. The sample data for testing the code are in the folder _data_. Finally, the repository contains a report of the implementation of the code. All the scripts were implemented in Python

## Running the Scripts

To run the scrips (task1.py and task2.py), clone the repository and navigate to the cloned folder. 
1. Run task1.py by typing _python task1.py data/sample\_simple\_ebola\_data.csv_ on a command prompt
2. Run task2.py by typing _python task2.py data/sample\_complex\_ebola\_data.csv_ data/sample_partial\_time\_series1.csv on a command prompt

Running any of the task will generate output files at the root of the folder containing the runtime and the ouputs. 

Note: The above path specifications are for a linux system. Change path to match your system's requirements. 

## Requirements
